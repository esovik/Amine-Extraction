# amineextract.sh

This is a simple script for extracting amine values from samples processed with ChemStation.
It will work equally well with non-amine compunds given a few simple changes.

Outputs a single .csv file.

More information is given in the .sh file.

# To-do:

* Move beyond amines (have the script detect compounds automatically from standards).
